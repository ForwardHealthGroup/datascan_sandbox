Using a cutoff score less than 6 has been found to provide excellent sensitivity for identifiying patients with substance abuse disorders as well as satisfactory specificity (i.e., identification of patients who do not have substance use disorders). Using a cutoff score of <11 somewhat reduces the sensitivity for identifying patients with substance abuse disorders, but more accurately identifies the patients who do not have a substance use disorders. Over 12 is definately a substance abuse problem. In a heterogenous psychiatric patient population, most items have been shown to correlate at least moderately well with the total scale scores.
