----------------------------- DATA SCAN QUICK GUIDE ----------------------------

# The data scan is a file located at:

/home/development/automation/datascan/datascan.py

# In order to make it simpler to run the scan, consider adding an alias for the
# data scan. You can do this by running the following command:

echo "alias scan='python /home/development/automation/datascan/datascan.py'" >> ~/.bash_profile; source ~/.bash_profile

# The following examples will use PCHC, but it could be any client.
# When the data scan is run, its results are saved to the client's
# "current" folder in a directory called "data_scans".

# To run the data scan on a client for the latest data, run:

scan pchc

# If you want to run the data scan for a different refresh, add the -r argument:

scan pchc -r 201806

# If you want to manually specify the directory(s) containing the old files
# for comparison, add the -o argument:

scan pchc -o /home/customers/pchc/current/20180508

# If you want to manually specify the directory(s) containing the new files for
# comparison, add the -n argument:

scan pchc -n /home/customers/pchc/current/20180606

# You can even manually specify both the old and new directories, and you can
# also compare files from multiple directories at once:

scan pchc -o /home/customers/pchc/current/20180405 -o /home/customers/pchc/current/20180508 -n /home/customers/pchc/current/20180606

# The default email recipients of the data scan do NOT recieve an email when you
# run the scan manually. They only get an email when the automatic scan runs.

# If you want to have the data scan email you the results, add the -e email
# argument (you can add as many "-e <email address>" arguments as you want):

scan pchc -e person.name@email.com

# If you want to add somebody's email address to the default list of recipients
# for a client, edit the following file:

/home/development/automation/datascan/CLIENT_CONFIG.json
